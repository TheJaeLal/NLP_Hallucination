Hallucination Critic Code (Milestone 2)
=======================================

Contains the task 1 code from milestone 2.

This notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab. You can change the root of the project with the
`PROJECT_ROOT` variable. It's expected that the `PROJECT_ROOT` directory exists, and that it has a subdirectory called
`data`. With this setup, the code should run as expected.
