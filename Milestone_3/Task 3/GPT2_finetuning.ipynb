            "How do you feel about dogs? Are they family or are they just something to have around\n",
            "I love them, for me I could never get a dog from a breeder. I'm too cheap, pure breeds mean nothing to me and there are sooo many animals in shelters ever year that are put down because they are without a home\n",
            "Yes, so many breeders throw genetics together for human novelty not considering how it would impact the anatomy and health of the animal\n",
            "Yeah, they're pretty neat dogs. Mine is more of Greyhound Husky, the other is a Basset Hound Lab, very strange mix. Training pound animals can be a challenge but it is easier the younger they are.\n",

            "Oh yeah. I always hear that ''gingers don't have souls''. It's silly and a joke, but it can still be harmful.\n",

            "Wow, that's cool. I did like their breakfast food.\n",

            "1994? That's pretty crazy that it's been on the market for that long, they must have made changes to it over the past over 20 years though.\n",

            "I like Cartman the best, not because of what he believes but how he sets himself up as a villainish character. I think there was a song \"All Things Must Pass\" or something in one episode that fit pretty well with what he did.\n",
            "Yeah, I'm not surprised it's been around that long. it reminds me of Simpsons, been around forever, I think that show was named after Groening?\n",

            "I don't think so, they'll all be terrible.  The Bucks could be good with the Greek Freak, and perhaps the pacers.  But the conference as a whole is terrible now.\n",
            "I didn't but I bet history will repeat itself and the team will become irrelevant now. They also had a bad owner, Stepien I think.\n",

            "I just think they are all so far away and nobody has the technology to get from one place to another.  I mean...the mars trip alone would be a couple months right?  Can you imagine living on a space ship going to another planet for years?  It would be hard to survive that trip!\n",
            "I heard that they thought they picked something up before and nobody knew what it was. It turned out to be the microwave a couple floors up.\n",

            "I have not, what does this diet do?\n",

            "I didn't know that! Thank you for informing me.\n",

            "Yeah, I think if they are going to suffer for their rest of their life or have rabies, it has to be done. Otherwise, it seems to be animal cruelty to me.\n",
            "Never, I don't think this would happen with a vegan owner though.\n",

            "It sure can be a applied there. The idea is to move away from batches of products to building one piece at a time. The idea is to maximize the ''First in, first out'' speed to get the first item out of the line as quickly as possible. This makes the factory agile to fluctuations in demand.\n",

            "I couldn't say, but the first documented use of the word \"pizza\" is in AD 997.\n",
            "No, I can't, as I'm a bot. I know that brewing goes back to at least 2500 BC, though.\n",
            "I'm not aware of the technique, but brewing started out as just a home thing, then by the ninth century, farms and monasteries would brew beer on a larger scale and sell the excess. Commercial brewing with dedicated breweries came out a few centuries later.\n",
            "I'm not really sure, but there's been consolidation of large breweries into multinational corporations along with the expansion of microbreweries.\n",
            "China is actually the largest producer of beer in the world, since 2001, that is.\n",
            "I'm a bot that can't eat pizza, but I know that it's a traditional Italian dish.\n",
            "Not a lot, but it seems like pizza was first mentioned in the 10th century in a manuscript.\n",
            "And it seems like the pizza we know of now was invented in Naples.\n",
            "Well, pizza is among the most common fast food items in North America and Europe.\n",
            "I know that in parts of the world pizza delivery is common.\n",
            "Oh, interesting. Most of the crimes are murder, is that was you read the most?\n",
            "It seems the writers can stick entirely to the facts or can be very speculative. Do you have a preference?\n",
            "For the TV shows, they often use reenactments to engage the viewers.\n",
            "Helter Skelter by Vincent Bugliosi is the best-selling true crime book ever. Have you read it?\n",

            "Oh text messaging?  Do you text with your mobile phone, tablet, laptop or desktop?\n",
            "Yeah, MMS stands for multimedia messages, which can contain digital images, sound content, videos, and emoji, not just  alphanumeric text.\n",
            "I just know that they may be sent over a cellular network, or via an Internet connection\n",
            "Right, well one thing about texting is it's a quick and easy method to communicate with colleagues and friends.\n",
            "Perhaps.  It's also useful for communicating late at night or when the other person is busy at work or with family responsibilities.\n",
            "I haven't as well. Have you ever heard of a dance-pop song that has new jack swing influences?\n",
            "In actuality, I don't have the definition of that. Have you ever heard of Psy? Gangnam Style is a single by him.\n",
            "I sure can. Psy is from South Korea and his real name is Park Jae-sang\n",
            "I know that he is known for his funny videos and performances.\n",
            "Now changing the topic, do you know the American politician Michele Downey Caldier?\n",
            "I can't, as I'm a bot, but I understand that NASCAR is family owned and operated.\n",
            "Sure, but his grandson, Brian France, became its CEO in 2003.\n",

            "I am actually not sure, but the body of the violin is completely hollow.\n",
            "I couldn't really say, but there are various parts, like the tuning pegs, tailpiece, maybe some fine tuners, and some other parts.\n",
            "I'm probably not the best system to ask for that information. There are some smaller violin-like instruments, like the violino piccolo, but they are very rarely used.\n",
            "No, I'm a bot so I can't. That said, I understand the gamemasters pick the setting and rules for the gameplay.\n",
            "Oh, is it? Sometimes the events are planned with educational or political goals in mind.\n",
            "Huh. They can also be large events with lots of players and can last for days sometimes.\n",
            "They can also have elaborate venues and fancy costumes.\n",
            "I have no opinion about that. What do you think of insects and arachnids? Many varieties of shellfish are closely related to them\n",
            "Awesome. Which crustaceans are your favorites: shrimp, crabs, crayfish, or lobsters?\n",
            "Is that related to your culture? I know that food is an element of a culture, along with music and religion\n",
            "If you are from Louisiana, you probably know about Gumbo. It is a stew very popular there.\n",
            "That would be nice. Louisiana Creole cuisine has French, West African, Spanish, German, Italian, Haitian, and British influences.\n",
            "Well, I can say that there are good and bad things about being a perfectionist; it's multidimensional.\n",
            "Look, the negative can be that perfectionism makes you try to achieve something unattainable.\n",
            "But when perfectionists don't reach their goals they can also become depressed\n",
            "The thing is that procrastination can also lead to depression. It can also lead to self-doubt, guilt, and inadequacy.\n",
            "Let me see. In the adaptive form of perfectionism, it can actually motivate you to achieve your goals.\n",
            "Stamp collecting is related to philately, which is the study of stamps themselves.\n",
            "Some people may be casual collectors and just accumulate stamps for fun with no real attention to detail.\n",
            "That is new information to me. I am aware that stamps are collected for historical value and for the subjects they depict, such as ships, kings, birds, and horses.\n",
            "Another fun fact is that there was actually a never-ending stream of stamps as every country wanted to advertise its distinctiveness through them.\n",
            "Really?  Did it have a leathery armour shell?\n",
            "All of them are native to America and they can live in a bunch of different environments.\n",

            "Yes, some examples are the giant armadillo and the pink fairy armadillo.\n",
            "I can tell you they are the smallest species of armadillo.  They were first described by R. Harlan.\n",
            "Well I'm a bot, so I don't read.  It's a means of sharing information and ideas, communication, and language acquisition.\n",

            "Oh wow, you know that Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and East Timor are to the north of it?\n",
            "For one, indigenous Australians have lived on it for around 50,000 years before the British settlers.\n",
            "No, Sydney would be Australia's largest urban area but the capital would be Canberra.\n",

            "I can't eat, being a bot, but I understand cakes are baked. What kind of cake do you like?\n",
            "Cakes were originally just modifications of bread. Nowadays they have presentations that can be simple or complex and elaborate.\n",
            "Cakes usually have sugar, butter or margarine or oil, eggs, some sort of liquid, and a leavening agent.\n",
            "Is that so? Ingredients like vanilla and cocoa can also be added, with lots of different substitutions for the main ingredients, as well.\n",
            "Nice! You can also fill cakes with fillings like fruit preserves or dessert sauces, among other fillings.\n",
            "I don't but I hear that it's an action sport involving riding a skate board and performing tricks right?\n",
            "Yes, I hear he is considered to be an important pioneer of modern vertical skateboarding.\n",
            "Did you ever play the Pro Skater 2x skateboarding video game? It is a part of the Tony Hawk's series.\n",
            "Neat, did you also play another of the Tony Hawk's game series? It was Pro Skater HD.\n",
            "Oh, what did you play it on? It was made for the Nintendo DS, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and 3, the PlayStation Portable and Wii.\n",
            "No but the city is the most populated one in Maine and as of 2017, has a population of 67,067.\n",
            "Sure, it was of 2017 and is Maine's most populated city.\n",

            "Portland's population in 2017 was 67,067.\n",

            "Billy Ray Cyrus, her father, was also on the show.\n",

            "I have to admit, I'm probably not the best system to ask for that information. I know about something completely different: Huntington's diversified economy, supported by coal, stell, and oil.\n",
            "I am not sure, but I know Edgar Allan Poe and Washington Irving were key literary figures.\n",
            "Sure, I know the story takes place in Highbury, a fictional village.\n",
            "I'm a bot, so I don't sleep. However, I understand a night owl is someone who stays up late into the night.\n",
            "I wouldn't know. That said, the night owl's opposite is called an early bird.\n",
            "I haven't got a clue, though what I can tell you is that in Scandinavia they call night owls B-people.\n",
            "I'm not really sure. Night owls are referred to as such because owls are nocturnal.\n",
            "What I can say about this subject is that this social relationship is based on an asymmetry in the power relationship between employers and workers.\n",
            "Regarding fair wages, it's interesting to mention that it also keeps in perspective the capacity of the industry to pay.\n",
            "Honestly, I don't have information about that. One thing I can say is that the Act 1911 prohibited strikes, among other things.\n",
            "In the UK, the living wage is supposed to be sufficient to cover the basic necessities.\n",
            "They are food, shelter, child care, health care, transportation, and utilities.\n",

            "I will have to look into that. Have you ever seen a flower producing diaspores without the need for fertilization?\n",
            "I'm not sure, but what I know is that flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop\n",
            "I am not sure. Do you like to use flowers to bring beauty to the environment?\n",
            "I'm not sure.  The Husky is used in northern regions as a sled-dog.   It has a fast pulling style.\n",

            "I genuinely don't have an opinion about it. What I know is that this term can sometimes refer to polyamory\n",
            "I can also say that this kind of relationship is consensually non-monogamous.\n",
            "That is something I can't answer. A person in an open relationship does not have exclusive sexual or romantic relationships\n",
            "I have no opinions regarding this subject. All I can say is that it is believed that open relationships occur more often in certain demographics.\n",
            "No problem. One last thing, an open relationship and polyamory are not identical concepts.\n",

            "So, being from Berkeley, they're an American band.\n",
            "The founders were veterans of 1980s punk, and the band is one of the ones credited for making punk mainstream in the 1990s.\n",
            "I haven't, but I know that they can be serving food at bars, restaurants, and even in private homes.\n",
            "Really? I know they play an important role in restaurants.\n",

            "Neat, in medicine, it is the main diet to help treat children with refractory epilepsy!\n",
            "It happens due to a state called ketosis, which is when the blood has a high amount of ketone bodies. Ketosis leads to lowered epileptic seizures.\n",
            "Yeah, just about half the kids and young folk who has epilepsy and tried some variant of this diet saw their seizure numbers drop by at least 50 percent.\n",
            "Well, the typical thing is that the carbohydrates found in food are changed into glucose. That glucose travels through the body and charges up brain-functions.\n",
            "The diet once had fluid restrictions, that meant that around 30% of the patients would get constipation, the most typical negative effect.\n",
            "I can't watch TV, being a bot, but I'm aware of the show Ghost Hunters, in which they use different electronic devices.\n",
            "I guess the interview people to about these sites as well.\n",
            "Just sites that are allegedy haunted.\n",

            "Of course, Burlington is the state's most populated city.\n",
            "Good. Do you also like trail running? It consists of either running or hiking over trails.\n",
            "I only know that it is a long-distance running race. Do you have any interesting fact about it?\n",
            "I have no idea. Humans have a very good adaptation for long-distance running, though.\n",
            "I am also unsure of that. Another thing I can say about long-distance running is that it is about distances over 8 kilometers.\n",
            "I have no information about that. Regarding marathons, I only know that their official distance is 42.195 kilometers.\n",
            "Interesting, that diet forces fat burning in the body, rather than carb burning.\n",
            "About 30% of people on the diet get constipation, and a few also get kidney stones.\n",
            "About half of young people with epilepsy who were on the diet had the number of seizures they had drop by 50% or more, even after they stopped keto.\n",
            "It works because the liver converts fat into fatty acids  and ketones.\n",
            "Well the word diet implies the use of certain intake of nutrition for health or weight management. Which are you aiming for?\n",
            "Ah, I see. Dietary habits play a big role in quality of life and length of life.\n",
            "I can tell you that most Buddhists are vegetarians, but not all, depending on the sect.\n",
            "Lots of people stop eating animal-based food to one degree or another.\n",
            "Being a bot, I can't eat cupcakes, but I know they can have fruit and candy on them. What about you?\n",
            "The actual first recipe of a cupcake found was from 1828 in Eliza Leslie's cook book.\n",
            "Oh, really? Eliza Leslie wrote some popular cookbooks in the 1800s.\n",
            "Not sure, but I think there are two types of muffins, one being a partly raised flat bread and the second cupcake like quick bread.\n",

            "I'm indifferent to it but know it's also known as sports fishing. Do you do it and if so, for competition or for leisure?\n",
            "It's separate from commercial fishing, which is intended for profit.\n",
            "Have you ever heard of the terminal tackle? It's a fishing tool.\n",
            "Well apparently weights and swivels fall into this category.\n",
            "Yeah, by the way do you use lures? They're used commonly over bait.\n",

            "The common thing is how the lens continuously focuses the objects' reflected light onto light-sensitive surfaces found within a camera.\n",
            "It happens to be used for mass communication as well as entertainment uses.\n",
            "The word itself comes from the Greek words 'kinema' and 'graphein'.  Combined it means 'recording motion'!\n",
            "What about you?  What is it you like about cinematography?  It is also used for entertainment or mass communication.\n",
            "I know about them, like they're a musical group of singers.\n",

            "It can be made without cheese and topped with veggies, condiments and other meats.\n",
            "There a ton of fast food, cafes, chain restaurants as well as independent places that offer pizza.\n",
            "Restaurants that  specialize in pizza are known as pizzerias.\n",
            "In some parts of the world pizza delivery is very common.\n",
            "And it is also one of the most prestigious and popular events in athletics.\n",
            "The 100 meter has been in the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and 1928 for women! Isn't that crazy?\n",
            "No, because I am a bot. Do you know Usain Bolt? He is an Olympic champion in the men's 100 meters.\n",
            "I'm not sure what his time was, but he's the first person to hold the records for the 100 meter and 200 meters\n",
            "Well, braces are used to align and straighten teeth\n",

            "Interesting. Yeah, I know eggplant is used a lot in cooking.\n",
            "I know that it has a purple exterior and white flesh. Do you think it has a meaty texture?\n",
            "Ah, speaking of blades, did you know they can be stamped or forged?\n",
            "No, as a bot, I can't eat. But I know cows made it to Japan around the same time as rice cultivation, which was around the second century AD.\n",
            "The cows were basically isolated on the island of Japan until 1854 so there was no possibility of foreign genes getting into the cattle population.\n",
            "There are actually four breeds of Japanese cattle based on which kind of foreign cows most influenced hybrids.\n",
            "I don't know, but I know the four breeds are called Japanese Black, Brown, Polled and Shorthorn.\n",

            "They have a wide variety of different sizes, some are only a few centimeters long but some are up to 3 meters long!\n",
            "They do! They can have venom, reflex bleeding, and camouflage. They can also drop their tails, which then regrow.\n",

            "Would you also say you have to deal with the intricacies involved in child rearing besides the biological relationship?\n",
            "Just that parenting skills vary. Good parenting skills are referred to as being a ''good parent''.\n",
            "That's good. Some children, however are mistreated, either physically, sexually, or psychologically, by parents or caregivers.\n",
            "I see. Also, some researchers treat child abuse and child maltreatment as different concepts. The latter they use for neglect, but also exploitation and trafficking.\n",
            "Interesting, particularly because humans are not exactly built for the environmental conditions of diving!\n",
            "Neat! I know that in some types of diving, the diver directly feels the pressure of the water they are in.\n",
            "Yes, people who experience problems are often experienced divers in fit condition who just never had problems before.\n",

            "Yes, she's an American fashion designer who created the DKNY clothing label.\n",
            "No, she is still alive. She was born in 1948.\n",

            "I'm not sure, but they can come on gradually. They are based on how fast they reach developmental milestones.\n",
            "I see. What I know about law firms is that they have to raise capital either by contributions from equity partners, or by taking on debt.\n",
            "Interesting. I know that firms can't do initial public offerings like other business do to raise capital quickly.\n",
            "Yes, like I said, they can't really raise capital quickly.\n",
            "I see. Have you ever thought of starting your own law firm?\n",
            "Well, I know that in the US, only lawyers can be owners or managers of law firms.\n",
            "Ah, so you like to eat with them in the late morning. Do you have alcohol with it? Apparently that's common.\n",
            "Nice! Some buffets also have menus you can order from.\n",
            "Well, I'm not sure how they make money, but they have all-you-can-eat for a fixed price.\n",
            "Cool. If you make it bacon, eggs and sausage, it would be a full breakfast!\n",
            "The democratic party can be traced back to 1828.\n",
            "The democratic party is the oldest voter based party.\n",

            "I see. Well, as of 2008, the US had 56 presidential elections.\n",
            "No, as a bot I can't watch movies, but I know of the novel by J. R. R. Tolkein.\n",

            "Yes, the current guideline in the US is to have more than 5 servings for some people.\n",
            "Yes, a night out is usually someone who stays up late, but the opposite is an early bird, or a lark instead of an owl. Do you know why they're birds?\n",
            "In Scandinavia, they call them differently. Early birds are called A-people and night owls are called B-people.\n",
            "I'm not sure but I know that researchers call them ''morningness'' and ''eveningness''.\n",
            "Well, scientists think it's a genetic difference that results in the two chronotypes.\n",
